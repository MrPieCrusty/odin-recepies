    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for the perfect lunch food when skiing in 
        the Austrian alps and in need of some energy. The dish is 
        a little like the brittish bubble and squeak in the sense
        that you basically just add a bunch of tasty things to the 
        pan with potatoes as a base. Slap a few eggs on there and 
        you are good to go!
    </p>
